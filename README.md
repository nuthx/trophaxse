# r/vitahacks trophy-hacking censorship continues!  
u/GeeGee-E removed my post about TrophaxSE just like they did with the original trophax.suprx    
please message the moderators of r/vitahacks and tell them to leave trophax alone. #FreeTROPHAX

# Will i get banned?  
Probably not, no one has ever gotten banned on vita  
even in the past when using other trophy hacks such as:  
TropHAX.suprx TrophyPather or PSVTrophyIsGood  
  
# TropHAXSE  
TropHAX Standalone Edition  
A homebrew app that can unlock trophys for any game.  
Unlike the original TropHAX.SUPRX however, this is compadible with 100% of games!  
You simply need the game installed and the trophy files inside ur0:/trophy and you can unlock stuffs!
